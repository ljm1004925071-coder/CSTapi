# CSTapi

This repository is a CST Studio Suite automation knowledge base for AI agents.

It contains:

- Bilingual CST automation skill guides in `skills/`
- A no-dependency MCP server for standardized CST reference and helper tools in `mcp/`
- Bilingual domain guides for complex antenna design evolution in `domain-guides/`
- A searchable CST installed macro index and usage guide in `macro-library/`
- Local copies of CST official automation-related documentation in `official-docs/`
- A source index for additional CST documentation installed under `D:\CST`

The intended split is:

- Skill files define model behavior, safety rules, and CST workflow strategy.
- MCP tools provide standardized calls for macro search, official-doc reads, History/VBA extraction, design records, and conservative CST Python helpers.
